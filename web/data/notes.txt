Elastic Search AI allows hybrid retrieval combining traditional BM25 keyword search 
with vector-based semantic search for deep contextual understanding. It is optimized 
for real-time analytics, security, and observability use cases, and can integrate 
with Vertex AI embeddings to deliver human-like search experiences.

This sample text demonstrates how the ingestion pipeline chunks text, creates embeddings, 
and indexes them into Elastic for hybrid retrieval during RAG workflows.
